##[Paranêl](www.tiago.co.nz/paranel)

Interface for generating G-Code for 3D printing parametric ring designs using FDM. An experiment using the CodeThread library for processing.

A quick experiment - mostly fully working but there are some bugs when using multiple sections for creating non-rotationally symmetrical forms.

There are variables for carve, feedRate, extrudeRate and pathPrecision in the code, that are not yet accessible in the GUI.

We cast some rings in chromium cobalt with help from Gito-Prótese dental prosthetics in Lisbon.
